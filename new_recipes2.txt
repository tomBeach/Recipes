instructions
FOR THE CRUST

• Beat in the flour just until combined and the dough begins to come together.
• Portion the dough into 24 1-inch balls (about a scant tablespoon each).
• Press each ball into a cup of a nonstick mini-muffin pan, spreading evenly over the bottom and 3/4 of the way up the sides, slightly higher if the cups are on the shallow side.
FOR THE FILLING
• In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the filling ingredients.
• Add a heaping teaspoon of the filling to create a small mound in each cup, making sure to distribute the pecans evenly by stirring the filling every few scoops.
• Bake until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.

Tarte Tatin

ingredients
8 large Golden Delicious apples (10 if smaller)
7 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 cup granulated sugar
Vanilla ice cream
1 recipe pie dough


instructions
FILLING
 • Peel the apples, then cut in half from top to bottom through their core. Scoop out the seeds and trim away any core or stem.
• Turn off the heat and sprinkle the sugar over the melted butter, letting it completely absorb, until it looks like wet sand.
 • Arrange 12 apple halves, stem side down, atop the sugar and butter in a circle at the perimeter of the pan. Apples should be nestled very tightly together.
  • Fit the remaining apple halves into the center.
• Over medium-low heat, bring the mixture to a rapid simmer for about 5 minutes.
 • Turn the heat to very low, and cook, rotating the pan occasionally, for 60 to 70 minutes. (The apples will begin to shrink within 10 minutes.  Rearrange as needed.)
 • Watch carefully and lower the heat further if the juices start to bubble up over the side of the pan.
 • As the apples shrink, use a spoon or spatula to lean them on one another for better aesthetic arrangement.
CRUST
• Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the pie dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.
• Take the skillet you will cook the apples in and place it upside down on the pastry, then use a sharp knife to cut around the perimeter of the skillet.
• Refrigerate the circle of dough until ready to use.
• After about 1 hour, the apples will have shrunk significantly.
• Using a fork or tongs, gently pluck one out to check the color. The parts of the apples that were in contact with the pan should be between toasted hazelnut and deep chestnut in color. Turn off the heat, and cool slightly, at least 30 minutes.
• Place the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.
• Retrieve the dough from the refrigerator and gently lay it over the apples.
• Place the skillet on a large, rimmed baking sheet and put it in the oven. Bake the tart 35 to 40 minutes, until the pastry is the color of almond skin.
 • Let the tart cool completely, then put in refrigerator OVERNIGHT.
• Place a plate that’s slightly larger than the skillet on top, ensuring that the rim clears the edge of the skillet on all sides.
• Using oven mitts, grip the pan in one hand and plate in the other and, over a sink, quickly and carefully flip the hot skillet — away from you — so the tart inverts onto the plate.  The tart may have shifted in its descent; use a spoon to nudge the apples back into formation.
• Let cool for at least 20 minutes, then serve as is, or with vanilla ice cream, creme fraiche, creme anglaise or caramel sauce.
 • Melt the butter over medium heat in a 10-inch high-sided cast iron skillet,
• Remove tart from fridge and warm on stove over medium-high heat for 1 minute, turning frequently.
• Place splayed hands on pastry and try rotating.  When it can rotate freely it is ready to flip.
