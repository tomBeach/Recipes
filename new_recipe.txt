instructions
 • Line a 7-by-11-inch baking dish with parchment paper and hold with 2 to 4 metal clips.
  • Place the butter, cocoa and brown sugar into a bowl set into a large strainer over a pot of simmering water.  Stir until the butter is melted and everything is smooth.
 • Add the egg and whisk until the mixture thickens. It will look and feel like chocolate pudding.
 • Beat the butter with a mixer on medium speed until it is light and creamy, about 2 minutes.
• Add the confectioners' sugar in three additions, alternating with the cream, then raise the speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
 • Add the peppermint schnapps, plus a drop or two of food coloring, if using, and beat until evenly combined.
 • Place the chocolate, butter and honey in a heatproof bowl set over a pan with a few inches of simmering water, ensuring the bottom of the bowl doesn
• Remove from the heat and pour the chocolate mixture over the peppermint filling, spreading into an even layer.
• Refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour.
• To serve, use the parchment paper to lift the mixture from the pan, then cut into pieces using a sharp knife.
• To create the diamonds, cut a series of vertical lines along the long side of the slab spaced about 1 inch apart.
• Then, cut a series of diagonal lines running across the vertical cuts, spaced about 1 1/2 inches apart along the short side, carrying the pattern all the way through the slab.
• For the cleanest slices, use a knife that's been heated in hot water, then dried, for each cut.
• Serve chilled.
 • Crush the biscotti into crumbs and transfer the crumbs to a large bowl.
 • Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla, coconut and salt. Transfer to the bowl with the biscotti crumbs, stirring until combined. Scrape into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer.
• Refrigerate while you make the peppermint layer.
