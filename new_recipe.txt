Pecan Tassies

ingredients
FOR THE CRUST
6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
4 ounces/113 grams cream cheese, at room temperature
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
½ teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour
FOR THE FILLING
1 large egg
¼ cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
⅔ cup/66 grams pecan halves, finely chopped

instructions
FOR THE CRUST
• Heat oven to 350 degrees.
• In a large bowl, either by hand or with an electric mixer, beat together butter, cream cheese, sugar and salt until creamy.
• Beat in the flour just until combined and the dough begins to come together.
• Portion the dough into 24 1-inch balls (about a scant tablespoon each).
• Press each ball into a cup of a nonstick mini-muffin pan, spreading evenly over the bottom and 3/4 of the way up the sides, slightly higher if the cups are on the shallow side.
FOR THE FILLING
• In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the filling ingredients.
• Add a heaping teaspoon of the filling to create a small mound in each cup, making sure to distribute the pecans evenly by stirring the filling every few scoops.
• Bake until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
• Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes, then remove the tassies from the tin to cool completely.
