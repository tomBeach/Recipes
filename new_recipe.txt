ingredients
CRUST
1 1/2 cup unbleached flour
3/8 tsp salt
2 tsp finely grated orange zest
7 Tbsp frozen unsalted butter (1/4" cubes)
1/3 cup frozen orange juice
2-3 Tbsp confectioners sugar

PASTRY CREAM
1/4 cup granulated white sugar
3 large egg yolks
1/8 cup all-purpose flour
Scant 3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/4 cups milk
1-2 teaspoons Vanilla extract

3/4 tablespoon liqueur (Grand Marnier, Brandy, Kirsch)

APRICOT GLAZE
1/2 cup apricot jam/preserves (clear glaze)
1 tablespoon Grand Marnier

instructions
CRUST
• Blend flour, salt and orange zest in food processor (2 1 sec pulses)
• Add frozen butter cubes and pulse process until blended (10 seconds).
• Run on continuous blend while adding ice water or orange juice until mix resembles pea-sized chunks and starts forming into a ball of dough (10 seconds).
• Smear with heel of hand onto cold work surface to blend layers.  Use minimal technique and work quickly to keep dough cold.
• Gather into flattened round (tart) or two flattened rounds (pie).
• Transfer the pastry to an 11 inch fluted tart pan.  Spread evenly and avoid pulling and over-working (causes shrinkage).
• Pack the mixture into the sides so that they are a scant 1/8-inch thick.
• Press the remainder into the bottom of the pan.  Prick bottom of dough to prevent it from puffing up as it bakes).
• Cover with oil and refrigerate at least 30 min while making fillings.
• Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
• Cover pastry with foil or parchment paper; fill with pie weights.
• Bake for 15-20 minutes until the tart is lightly browned.
• Remove tart and set oven for broiling.
• Sprinkle confectioners sugar onto bottom of crust.
• Wrap edges with aluminum foil; place crust under broiler until sugar melts (1-2 minutes).
• Remove and set aside to cool.

PASTRY CREAM
• In a medium-sized stainless steel bowl, mix the sugar and egg yolks together with a wooden spoon. (Never let the mixture sit too long or you will get pieces of egg forming.)
• Sift the flour and cornstarch together and then add to the egg mixture, mixing until you get a smooth paste.  Set aside.
• In a saucepan, combine the milk, vanilla, and orange zest on medium heat until boiling.  (The milk will foam up to the top of pan when done, so watch carefully.)
• Remove from heat and add slowly to egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.  (If you get a few pieces of egg curdling, pour through a strainer.)
• Place the egg mixture back into a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until boiling, whisking constantly.  When it boils, whisk mixture constantly for another 30 - 60 seconds until it becomes very thick and it is hard to stir.
• Remove from heat and immediately whisk in the liqueur.  Pour into a clean bowl and immediately cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a crust from forming.  Cool.
• If not using right away refrigerate until needed (up to 3 days).  Beat before using to get rid of any lumps that may have formed.

APRICOT GLAZE
• Whisk the jam/jelly/preserves in a small saucepan over medium heat until liquid (melted), about 2 minutes.
• Remove from heat and strain through a fine strainer to remove any fruit lumps.
• Add the liqueur.  Let cool until it is only slightly warm.
• Lightly glaze the fruit using a pastry brush.
• Dust with powdered sugar and serve with vanilla ice cream.


Chocolate Mousse Cake
https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/chocolate-mousse-cake/16997/?utm_term=.6835efc7a524

ingredients
CAKE
6 large eggs, separated into yolks and whites, at room temperature
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped and melted
3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 tablespoons cake flour

MOUSSE
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped, melted and kept lukewarm
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (optional)

GANACHE
10 ounces bittersweet or dark chocolate chopped
1 3/4 cups heavy cream
About 1 cup chocolate sprinkles (optional)

instructions
CAKE
• Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
• Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet with cooking oil spray, then line the bottom with parchment paper.
• Combine the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of the sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer or use a handheld electric mixer; beat on medium-high speed, until light, thick and fluffy, for about 5 minutes. The mixture should nearly triple in volume and fall off the beaters in a thick ribbon.
• Add the vanilla extract; beating on medium-high speed, then add all the melted/cooled bittersweet chocolate, and beat until just incorporated.
• Beat the egg whites in a separate, clean bowl using the balloon-whisk attachment on your stand mixer or with the handheld electric mixer on medium-high speed; once they are foamy, add the cream of tartar.
• Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until soft peaks form.
• Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.
• Gently fold a small amount of beaten egg whites into the egg yolk-chocolate mixture, to loosen it up.
• Fold in a third of the remaining beaten egg whites (some white streaks can remain), then sift in a tablespoon of the cake flour and gently fold to incorporate.
• Repeat with the remaining beaten egg whites and the remaining tablespoon of cake flour until everything is just incorporated.
• Transfer the batter to the baking sheet, trying not to deflate it. Use an offset spatula to spread it evenly into the corners.
• Bake (middle rack) for 17 minutes, until the top of the cake springs back when lightly pressed. The cake should be a light brown, similar in color to brown sugar.
• Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely.

MOUSSE
• Combine the egg whites and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a balloon-whisk attachment or use a handheld electric mixer; beat on medium-high speed until soft peaks form.
• Gradually add the sugar, beating until glossy, soft peaks form.
• Beat the heavy whipping cream in a separate clean bowl (using your stand mixer fitted with a balloon-whisk attachment or a handheld electric mixer) until soft peaks form.
• By hand, fold half the lukewarm chocolate into the whipped cream with a spatula until incorporated, then fold in the remaining chocolate to form a smooth, homogenous mixture.
• Gently fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate whipped cream until just blended, then fold in the remaining beaten egg whites. Gently fold in the mini chocolate chips or chopped chocolate, if using.
• Cover and refrigerate the mousse until chilled, but no longer than 30 minutes, or the mousse may become too stiff to work with.

GANACHE
• Place the 10 ounces of bittersweet or dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl.
• Heat the heavy cream in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, just until bubbles form at the edges.
• Immediately pour over the chocolate; let the mixture sit for a minute or two, then whisk to form a smooth, glossy ganache. Let it cool for a bit while you begin the cake assembly.
• Invert the cake slab onto a cutting board and discard its parchment paper. Cut the cake into 3 rectangles of equal size.
• Place one portion on a large serving platter or plate. Use a piping bag or offset spatula to spread half the chilled mousse on the bottom cake layer.
• Next, stack another portion of cake on the mousse layer, pressing it lightly in place without forcing out any of the mousse below.
• Follow with the remaining mousse, then top with the remaining cake portion, again pressing it lightly in place.
• Use an offset spatula to spread the slightly cooled ganache over the top and sides of the cake, keeping things neat.
• If desired, press handfuls of the chocolate sprinkles against the sides of the cake (or decorate as you wish).
• Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to overnight.
• Let the cake come to room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
