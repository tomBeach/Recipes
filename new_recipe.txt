Rigatoni and Cauliflower al Forno

ingredients
1 pound rigatoni or other large pasta shape
1 medium cauliflower (1 1/2 pounds)
Extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper
1 tablespoon capers, roughly chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste
3 tablespoons roughly chopped sage, plus a few sage leaves left whole
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
6 ounces coarsely grated fontina or mozzarella
2 ounces finely grated Romano cheese or other hard pecorino
1/2 cup coarse dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish


instructions
• Cook the rigatoni in well-salted water, but drain while still quite al dente (e.g. 12 minutes => 10 instead).
• Rinse pasta with cool water, then drain again and set aside.
• Heat oven to 400 degrees.
• Cut cauliflower in half from top to bottom. Cut out tough core and stem any extraneous leaves.
• Lay cauliflower flat side down and cut crosswise into rough 1/4-inch slices. Break into smaller pieces.
• Put 3 tablespoons olive oil in a wide skillet over high heat.
• Add cauliflower slices, along with any crumbly pieces, in one layer. (Work in batches if necessary.)
• Let cauliflower brown and caramelize for about 2 minutes, then turn pieces over to brown the other side.
• Cook for another 2 minutes, or until the cauliflower is easily pierced with a fork. (It’s fine if some pieces don’t brown evenly.)
• Season generously with salt and pepper.
• Add capers, garlic, red pepper flakes, chopped sage, sage leaves and lemon zest and stir to coat.
• Put cooked cauliflower mixture in a large mixing bowl. Add cooked rigatoni and fontina and toss.
• Transfer mixture to a lightly oiled baking dish.
• Top with Romano cheese, then with bread crumbs and drizzle with about 1 tablespoon olive oil.
• Bake, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes, until top is crisp and golden.
• Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley before serving.
