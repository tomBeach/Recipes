3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 cup dried French (Le Puy) lentils, washed
1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream (double cream)

instructions
• Heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
• Soak and carefully rinse the leek rounds in water, then drain and pat dry.
• Add the leeks, garlic, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper to a 12-by-8-inch baking dish.
• Mix gently to combine, then pour the oil on top.
• Arrange the leeks cut-side up, then cover tightly with foil and bake for 35 minutes.
• Remove the baking dish from the oven and gently turn the leeks using two forks.
• Cover again with foil and return to the oven to bake until completely softened, about 35 minutes more.
• Turn the oven temperature up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
• As the leeks bake, fill a medium saucepan about two-thirds of the way with water and bring to a boil over high.
• Add the lentils and cook until just tender but not at all mushy, 12 to 15 minutes.
• Drain well and set aside.
• When ready, remove the confit leeks from the oven and transfer a heaping 1/2 cup of the cooked leeks plus 5 of the garlic cloves to a bowl for the leek cream.
• Add the cooked lentils to the remaining leeks in the baking dish.
• Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper and mix gently to combine.
• Cover again with the foil and return to the oven for 15 minutes.
• Remove the foil and leave to settle for 10 minutes. Discard the thyme sprigs.
• Add reserved leeks and garlic to a food processor along with the heavy cream, mustard, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1/8 teaspoon of salt.
• blitz until smooth.
• When ready, stir the remaining 4 tablespoons lemon juice and the chopped herbs into the lentil and leek mixture.
• Transfer to a rimmed platter and serve with the leek cream in a bowl alongside.
