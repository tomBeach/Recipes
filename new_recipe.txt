instructions
• Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
CHILES:
• Use tongs to place the poblano chiles directly over the open flame of a gas burner set to high.
• Cook the poblanos until totally charred all over, turning as needed, about 2 minutes per side.
• Transfer to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap so the poblanos can steam.
• After 10 minutes, use your fingers to pull the blackened skins away from the poblanos, then remove the stems and seeds.
• Roughly chop the poblanos and set aside.
• While the poblano chiles steam, place a large skillet over medium heat.
• Working in batches to cook the guajillo chiles evenly in one layer, flatten the chile halves on the hot skillet and toast them for about 15 seconds, turning once.
• Put the chiles in a bowl and add 2 cups hot water to help soften them. Set aside.
MEAT:
• Season the meat all over with the salt.
• Heat the oil in a large, oven-proof pot over medium-high.
• Working in batches, sear the meat on all sides until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
• Transfer the browned meat to a large bowl as you work.
• After you’ve seared all the meat, add the onion to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes.
• Return all the meat to the pot.
• Meanwhile, add the tomatoes, vinegar, garlic, ginger, oregano, sesame seeds, cumin, cloves and a few grinds of black pepper to a blender, along with the chopped poblanos, toasted guajillos and the chile soaking liquid.
• Purée until smooth, scraping down the edges of the blender as needed.
• Pour the blended mixture into the pot with the meat.
• Add the cinnamon stick and bay leaves, along with about 4 to 6 cups of water, enough to amply cover the meat.
• Cover and cook in the oven until the meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.
• Divide among bowls and sprinkle with cilantro.
• Serve with lime wedges for squeezing on top, and a side of warm tortillas.
