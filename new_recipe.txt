instructions
• In a Dutch oven or deep-sided pot over medium-high heat, melt the butter.
• Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour turns light tan, 3 to 5 minutes.
• Add the onion, bell pepper and celery and cook, stirring, until the vegetables soften, 6 to 8 minutes.
• Add the diced tomatoes, broth, tomato sauce, garlic, bay leaf, Creole seasoning, if using, thyme, salt and cayenne.
• Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally until thickened and most of the liquid evaporates, 15 to 20 minutes.
• Add the shrimp and lemon juice and cook just until the shrimp curl, turn pink and are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes, depending on their size.
• If the mixture is too thick, add broth or water, a few tablespoons at a time, until you reach the desired consistency.
• Discard the bay leaf, if desired, and taste the sauce, adding more salt and cayenne as desired.
• Stir in the parsley, ladle over rice and garnish with parsley or scallions, if using.
• Serve with hot sauce, if desired.
