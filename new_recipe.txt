Cauliflower Adobo

ingredients
1 large cauliflower (2 1/2 to 3 pounds)
 Kosher salt
2 teaspoons black pepper, plus more as needed
3 tablespoons canola oil, plus more as needed
1/2 cup rice-wine vinegar
5 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons raw or light brown sugar
6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
3 bay leaves
1 Thai chile, halved lengthwise, or 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
3 scallions, thinly sliced, for serving


instructions
• Trim leaves and woody stalk from the cauliflower, then cut through the root into 8 wedges.
• Season both sides of each wedge with salt and pepper. Reserve any loose cauliflower pieces.
• In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
• Place one layer of the wedges in the skillet cut-side down and cook without moving them until well browned on one side, 3 to 4 minutes.
• Transfer to a plate and continue until all the cauliflower is seared, adding more oil as needed.
• Return all the cauliflower to the pan with uncooked side facing down.
• Add 1/4 cup water, any loose cauliflower pieces, 2 teaspoons black pepper, rice-wine vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, bay leaves and Thai chile.
• Cover and let simmer over medium heat until the cauliflower is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.
• Uncover, turn the heat to medium-high, and cook, basting the cauliflower occasionally with the sauce, until the cauliflower is tender and the sauce has thickened and reduced to about 3/4 cup, 8 to 10 minutes.
• Serve the cauliflower with plenty of sauce and a sprinkle of scallions.
