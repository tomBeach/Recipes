FOR THE GARNISH
• Heat the oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over low heat.
• Add the barberries and grape molasses or sugar; stir-fry for 1 minute to coat the barberries and soften them a bit.
• Transfer to a small bowl.
FOR THE KUKU
• Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in same skillet over medium heat.
• Add the onion and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until it has softened and begun to turn golden.

• Break the eggs into a large mixing bowl.
• Add the baking powder, Persian spice blend, salt, pepper and turmeric.
• Use a fork to whisk, then add the garlic, lettuce, scallions, parsley, cilantro, dill, dried fenugreek, walnuts, flour and the cooked onion.
• Use a spatula to gently fold the mixture; do not overmix.
• Heat the remaining 6 tablespoons of oil in the skillet over medium-low heat.
