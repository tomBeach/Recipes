Chicken Francese II

ingredients
2 eggs
2 tablespoons whole milk
1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup vegetable oil
4 to 6 large boneless, skinless chicken cutlets (buy the cutlets thinly sliced, or buy regular boneless breasts and slice them in half horizontally to make thin pieces)
3 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 lemon, thinly sliced, seeds removed (optional)
1/2 cup dry white wine
 Freshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon, more to taste
2 cups chicken stock
3 to 4 tablespoons freshly minced parsley

instructions
• In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk eggs, milk, salt and pepper until blended.
• Place the flour in a separate bowl. Line a baking sheet with paper towels.
• In a wide skillet, heat olive and vegetable oils over medium heat until shimmering.
• Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, lightly dredge the chicken in flour and shake off any excess.
• Dip into egg batter, let excess batter drip back into the bowl and place in the skillet.
• Fry, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side.
• Adjust the heat as the cutlets cook so they brown slowly and evenly, with a steady bubbling.
• Transfer to the paper-towel-lined pan and repeat with remaining cutlets.
• When all cutlets are browned, remove the pan from the heat and pour off the oil.
• Wipe out the pan with paper towels. Return the pan to low heat.
• Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter and then scatter the lemon slices over the bottom of the pan.
• Cook, stirring gently occasionally, until the lemon slices are golden and browning around the edges, about 3 minutes.
• Scoop out the lemon slices and set them aside.
• Add 3 tablespoons of butter, the wine and lemon juice and bring to a boil.
• Boil until the liquid is syrupy, 3 to 4 minutes.
• Pour in the stock, bring to a boil and cook until thickened into a sauce, about 5 minutes. (It will thicken more when you add the cutlets.)
• Taste and adjust the seasonings with lemon, salt and pepper; it should be quite lemony and not too salty.
• Reduce the heat, return the cutlets to the pan and simmer until the sauce is velvety and the chicken pieces are heated through, about 4 minutes.
• Turn the cutlets over occasionally in the sauce.
• Place the browned lemon slices on top.
• Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve, spooning some of the sauce over each serving.
