Herbed Chicken and Spinach Meatballs

ingredients
2 cups (1 pound) spinach, washed
1 1/2 pounds ground chicken
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
Pinch of ground cayenne
Pinch of ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon crushed fennel seeds
Pinch of ground cinnamon
1 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
1 serrano chile, with seeds, finely chopped
1 egg, beaten
1 cup soft fresh bread crumbs, from about 4 slices of crustless sandwich bread
1/2 cup heavy cream, half-and-half or milk
All-purpose flour, for dusting
Extra-virgin olive oil, for frying
Lime or lemon wedges, for serving


instructions
• Plunge spinach a handful at a time into a pot of boiling water. Leave just long enough to wilt, about 30 seconds, then drain in a colander and cool under running water.
• Remove and squeeze wilted leaves into a ball.
• Using a large knife, roughly chop spinach on a cutting board. Squeeze into a ball again to remove excess water. (This may be done several hours or up to a day in advance and refrigerated.)
• In a large bowl, put chicken, salt, pepper, lemon zest, cayenne, nutmeg, fennel seeds, cinnamon, spinach, cilantro, chile, egg, bread crumbs and cream.
• Using your clean hands, knead everything together, mixing well. Leave to absorb seasoning for 15 minutes or overnight.
• Test for seasoning: Take a small amount and flatten into a thin patty. Quickly cook in a small skillet, about 1 minute per side. Taste, then adjust the mixture’s seasoning if necessary.
• Using an ice cream scoop or spoon, form 24 rough balls and place on a baking sheet. (The mixture will be soft.)
• Lightly sprinkle the balls with a very small amount of flour.
• Set a large, wide skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil to a depth of 1/4 inch.
• When oil is wavy, use a spoon to help slip in balls into skillet.
• Gently fry the balls without crowding. Adjust heat as necessary (high heat will make them tough.)
• Cook for about 4 minutes per side; they should be golden brown, not too dark.
• Serve with lime or lemon wedges.

instructions
SEASONING
• Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and purée.
• Use epis or transfer to a large jar and refrigerate for up to 6 weeks.

SOUP
• Rinse the beef with lukewarm water, then transfer the meat to a large bowl.
• Add the lime juice and rub it into the meat until coated.
• Add 5 tablespoons epis seasoning and toss to coat.
• Cover and refrigerate to marinate, ideally overnight or for at least 30 minutes.
• When ready to cook, purée the calabaza squash with 1 cup water in a blender; set aside.
• In a large pot, heat the oil over medium. Add the meat with its marinade, the tomato paste and bouillon cube, crushing it between your fingertips.
• Cook the meat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture caramelizes and darkens, about 10 minutes.
• Transfer the meat to a bowl to set aside.
• Add 6 cups water to the pot and bring to a boil over high heat.
• Stir in the squash purée, potatoes, cabbage, carrots, onion, celery, scallions, parsley, Scotch Bonnet pepper, thyme, salt and pepper, and bring to a boil again.
• Stir in the meat with its juices.
• Once the mixture comes to a boil, cover the pot, reduce the heat to simmer over low, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
• Remove and discard the Scotch bonnet pepper. (Do not let it burst. If it does, your soup will be very spicy!)
• Stir in the vermicelli. Cook, stirring occasionally, for another 10 minutes.

DUMPLINGS
• Combine the flour, oil, salt, pepper and 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl and stir to combine. (You can knead slightly, if needed, to get the dough to come together.)
• Take about 1 tablespoon of dough and roll it between your palms into an elongated shape the width of your palm, about 4 inches long.
• Add the dumpling to the soup and continue to make dumplings with the remaining dough, dropping them into the soup as they are rolled.
• Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until dumplings are softened and cooked through but still firm, 15 to 20 minutes.
• If the soup is too thick for your taste, stir in water, about 1 cup or as desired.
• Remove pot from heat and serve warm.
