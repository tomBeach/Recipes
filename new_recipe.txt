instructions
• Add 2 tablespoons butter or oil to a large Dutch oven or pot and set it over medium heat.
• When the fat is hot, stir in half the mushrooms and half the pearl onions.
• Without moving them around too much, cook the mushrooms until they are brown on one side, about 3 minutes.
• Stir and let them brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more.
• Use a slotted spoon to transfer mushrooms and onions to a large bowl or plate and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
• Repeat with another 2 tablespoons butter and the remaining mushrooms and pearl onions, seasoning them as you go.
• Reduce heat to medium-low. Add another 1 tablespoon butter or oil to pan.
• Add leeks and carrot and sauté until the leeks turn lightly golden and start to soften, 5 minutes.
• Add the 2 minced garlic cloves and sauté for 1 minute longer.
• Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
• Stir in flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute, then add wine, broth, 1 tablespoon tamari, thyme and bay leaf, scraping up the brown bits at bottom of pot.
• Add reserved cooked mushrooms and pearl onions back to the pot and bring to a simmer.
• Partly cover the pot and simmer on low heat until carrots and onions are tender and sauce is thick, 30 to 40 minutes.
• Taste and add more salt and tamari if needed.
• Stir in the grated garlic clove.
• Just before serving, heat a small skillet over high heat and add 1/2 tablespoon butter or oil.
• Add half of the sliced chanterelles or oyster mushrooms and let cook without moving until they are crisp and brown on one side, 1 to 2 minutes.
• Flip and cook on the other side.
• Transfer to a plate and sprinkle with salt and smoked paprika.
• Repeat with remaining butter and mushrooms.
• Serve mushroom Bourguignon over polenta, noodles or mashed potatoes, topped with fried mushrooms and parsley.
