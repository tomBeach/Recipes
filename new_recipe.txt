Spinach Timbales with Sauteed Tomatoes

ingredients
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup whole milk
2 garlic cloves, smashed
1 tablespoon parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon gruyere cheese
1 tablespoon butter
1 large shallot, minced
1/2 pound spinach leaves only (this equates to about 13 oz spinach with the stems on)
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (to taste)
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
juice from 1/4 lemon
1 teaspoon flour
1 1/2 large eggs
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 tablespoon butter
salt and pepper to taste


instructions
• Preheat the oven to 375F.
• Butter the molds you will use and line the bottoms with buttered parchment paper.
• Reduce the chicken broth to about 1 tablespoon. It will thicken and become almost like a glaze. Set aside.
• Combine the milk, cream and smashed garlic in a small pot and bring to a gentle simmer.
• Simmer for 10 minutes, turn off the heat and steep with the garlic for 20 minutes.
• Remove the garlic and add the cheese, reheating slightly if necessary to melt the cheese.
• Add the reduced chicken broth. Set aside.
• In a saute pan, melt the butter and keep it over medium heat while it turns a deep golden brown.
• When it's a nut brown, add the shallots and saute until soft, about 4-5 minutes.
• Add the spinach and lemon juice, constantly turning to completely wilt the leaves.
• Add the nutmeg, salt and white pepper and saute another minute. Remove from the pan, finely chop, and return to the pan.
• Sprinkle the flour evenly over the spinach mixture and saute for 1-2 minutes.
• Add the milk/cream/broth base, bring to a simmer and remove from heat to cool.
• When cool, whisk the egg pretty thoroughly and add to the mixture.
• Pour into the molds. Place the molds in a baking pan and fill the pan with hot water half way up the sides of the molds.
• Bake for 20 minutes or until set.
• Remove from the oven and let sit for 5-10 minutes to allow the custard base to set up.
• Run a sharp knife around the outside and carefully flip over to unmold onto a plate.
• Saute the tomatoes in the butter. Salt and pepper to taste and spoon over the spinach timbales.
