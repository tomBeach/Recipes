instructions
BABANAS FOSTER
• Peel the bananas and cut them crosswise into 1/2-inch slices.
• Melt butter in a medium (10-inch) skillet over medium heat.
• Stir in the brown sugar and cinnamon, then add the sliced bananas.
• Cook, stirring occasionally, until a sugary syrup forms, 2 to 3 minutes.
• Turn off the flame (or if using an electric stove, pull the skillet off the heat) and add the liquor, if using.
• Return pan to the heat and, if using a gas stove, slightly tilt the pan near the flame to flambé. (If using an electric stove, light the liquid with a long-reach lighter.) Let the flames die down, swirling the pan until the alcohol burns off.
• Reduce heat to low and stir briefly with a wooden spoon. (Alternatively, skip adding the alcohol, add buttermilk and cook sauce just until the liquid reduces slightly.) Strain liquid from bananas into a medium bowl to separate bananas and sauce;
• set both aside.
CAKE
• Heat oven to 325 degrees and generously coat a 10-inch/12-cup Bundt cake pan with nonstick cooking spray.
• In a stand mixer or with a hand-held mixer on medium speed, cream together granulated sugar and butter until light and fluffy, about 4 to 5 minutes.
• Sift the flour into a medium bowl.
•  In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, mix together the sour cream and buttermilk.
• Once the butter is creamed, add 1 egg at a time and mix until each is fully incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.
• Add half the flour and mix on low speed until fully incorporated.
• With the mixer running, add the buttermilk mixture in a slow, steady stream and mix until fully incorporated.
• Add the remaining flour and mix.
• Once fully combined, add the vanilla and mix to incorporate.
• By hand, fold in strained bananas.
• Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth evenly.
• Bake for 65 to 80 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean.
GLAZE
• Sift the confectioners’ sugar into the bowl with the reserved banana sauce and whisk to combine.
• If the glaze is too thick, thin with water (or buttermilk), 1 tablespoon at a time, until it’s smooth, drizzles easily and coats the back of a wooden spoon.
• Once cake has cooled, invert it onto a large serving plate, and spoon the glaze over.
• Slice the cake and serve with ice cream or whipped cream and candied pralines, if desired.
