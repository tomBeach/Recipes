== Skillet-Braised Spiced Potatoes and Chickpeas ==

ingredients
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium onion, cut into small dice (1 cup)
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
15 oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/2 tsp salt, or to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
1 cup chicken broth
2 to 3 stems flat-leaf parsley or cilantro, finely chopped
3 to 4 scallions, white and light-green parts, cut into thin slices
2 3/4 lbs red potatoes, peeled, if desired, and cut into 3/4-inch chunks


instructions
• Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.
• Add the onion, stirring to coat, then reduce the heat to medium. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until just softened.
• Add the spices and stir to combine; cook for 1 minute.
• Add the potatoes, chickpeas, about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the pepper to taste.
• Stir to coat the potatoes evenly, then add the chicken broth.
• Let the broth come to a boil, then cover the skillet and reduce the heat to medium or medium-low. (The broth should bubble at the edges.)
• Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the potatoes are just tender.
• Uncover and increase the heat to medium-high.
• Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes, until the broth has reduced and thickened slightly. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.
• Transfer to a serving dish and top with the scallions and parsley. Serve hot.
