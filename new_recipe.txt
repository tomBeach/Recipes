ingredients
4 peppercorns
1 bay leaf
1 lemon, cut into eighths
1 pound cod fillets, or other white flaky fish
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 ribs celery, trimmed, peeled and diced
1 medium-size yellow onion, peeled and diced
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 heaping tablespoon mayonnaise, homemade or store-bought
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 heaping cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 bunch parsley, roughly chopped
1/4 cup neutral oil, like canola

instructions
• Fill a shallow, wide pan with high sides with about an inch of water, and set it over high heat.
• Add the peppercorns, bay leaf and 1 section of the lemon to the water, and allow it to come to a bare simmer.
• Place the fish into this poaching liquid, and cook, barely simmering, until the flesh has just begun to whiten all the way through, approximately 6 to 8 minutes.
• Using a wide spatula, carefully remove the fish from the water, and set aside to cool.
• Empty the pan, and return it to the stove, over medium-high heat.
• Add the butter, and allow it to melt, swirling it around the pan.
• When the butter foams, add the celery, onions and garlic, and sauté, stirring often, until the vegetables soften and the onions turn translucent, then transfer them to a large bowl.
• In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, eggs, salt, pepper, and Old Bay (or paprika and hot-pepper flakes).
• Add this mixture to the bowl with the sautéed vegetables.
• Pour the bread crumbs over them and stir to combine.
• Add the parsley, and stir again.
• Flake the cooked fish into the binding sauce carefully, keeping the flakes as whole as you can manage.
• Gather into small balls, and form them into 4-6 patties (main course).
• Place them on a sheet pan or platter, cover loosely with plastic wrap and transfer them to the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to set.
• Set a large sauté pan over high heat, and add to it the neutral oil.
• When the oil is shimmering, remove the fish cakes from the refrigerator, and carefully sauté the patties until they are golden brown, approximately 4 to 5 minutes a side.
• Smear the exterior of the patties with mayonnaise to give them a crisp crust.
• Serve with the remaining wedges of lemon.
