Pistachio & Raspberry Pavlova Roulade
https://thekiwicook.com/2014/02/07/pistachio-raspberry-pavlova-roll/


ingredients
CAKE
5 egg whites, room temperature
Pinch of salt
1 cup caster (superfine) sugar
3/4 cup pistachios, roughly chopped

FILLING
10 fl oz cream
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup fresh raspberries
Icing sugar, for dusting (optional)

COMPOTE
3 cups fresh or frozen fruit
3 Tbsp orange juice
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp fresh ginger
1 tsp raw sugar

instructions
CAKE
• Line a 10 x 14 inch roll pan with baking paper.
• Place the egg whites and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk them until soft peaks form.
• Add the sugar gradually, a tablespoonful at a time, beating well until the mixture is thick and glossy, about 8-10 minutes.
• Preheat the oven to 340°F.
• Use a spatula to carefully fold half the chopped pistachios through the mixture.
• Spoon the meringue into the prepared pan and smooth the top, trying not to knock too much air out of the mixture.
• Sprinkle over the remaining pistachios.
• Bake the meringue in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until the meringue is crispy on the top, set firmly inside, and slightly coloured.
• Set the meringue aside for a few minutes to cool. The meringue will deflate as it cools – this is totally normal.
• Place a large piece of baking paper onto a flat baking tray. Turn the tray and baking paper upside-down on top of the roll pan and turn the whole thing over. The pavlova roll should plop gently out of its pan onto the baking paper/tray.
• Carefully peel the baking paper liner off the pavlova roll, cover it with a clean tea towel and leave it to cool. Remove the baking tray.

FILLING
• When you are ready to fill the pavlova roll, whip the cream and vanilla essence together to soft peaks (not stiff).
• Spread the whipped cream evenly onto the cooled pavlova roll, leaving a 2 inch border at one of the short ends.
• Sprinkle over the berries.
• Turn the pavlova roll (on the baking paper) so that the short end is closest to you and the 5cm gap is at the other end, and start rolling it into a log shape, using the baking paper to do so. The cream mixture will slide a little as you’re rolling it (hence the 5cm (2 inch) border at the end!)
• Slide or lift the pavlova roll carefully onto a platter, with the join at the bottom.
• Dust it with icing sugar, if using.
• Cut into slices and serve with extra berries and/or a berry coulis.

COMPOTE
• Place fruit and juice in a small saucepan and bring to medium heat.
• Once bubbling, reduce heat slightly and use a wooden spoon to muddle and mash the fruit.
• Add cinnamon, sugar and ginger.
• Continue cooking over medium-low heat for 10-12 minutes, occasionally mashing fruit to combine.
• Remove from heat and spread onto pavlova roll.

Apple Cranberry Crumb Pie

ingredients
CRUST
2 1/2 cups (313 grams) flour, plus more for dusting the counter
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
8 ounces (226 grams/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
6 to 10 tablespoons ice water

FILLING
2 to 2 1/2 pounds mixed apples, such as Granny Smith, Fuji and Gala, peeled, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick
Generous 1 cup (120 grams) fresh cranberries (defrosted and drained, if frozen)
1/4 cup (50 grams) packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar
2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons instant tapioca
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter

CRUMBLE
Scant 1/2 cup (60 grams) flour
1/2 cup (99 grams) packed light brown sugar
1/3 cup (34 grams) old-fashioned oats
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
Pinch of kosher salt
4 tablespoons (56 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes

instructions
CRUST
• In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt.
• Add the butter and, moving quickly, use your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until some butter pieces are the size of peas and small beans.
• Create a well in the butter and flour mixture and pour in 6 tablespoons cold water. Using a fork, bring the dough together and moisten all the flour bits.
• If there are significant sections of the flour and butter that are dry, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until a moist and shaggy dough starts to form.
• Dump the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently knead it into a cohesive piece, then divide in half and form each piece into a disk.
• Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate one disk for 1 hour; freeze the other one for up to 3 months.
• Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the refrigerated dough to a 13-inch circle.
• From time to time, rotate the dough a quarter turn to ensure it isn’t sticking to the work surface. If you see the dough spring back when rolling, the butter is too warm.  Chill the pie crust in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before rolling again.
• Gently fold the crust into quarters and place it in the pie dish, then unfold so that the crust hangs over the side.
• Transfer to the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.

FILLING
• In a large bowl, combine the apples, cranberries, both sugars, tapioca, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt, and gently toss to distribute.
• Remove the crust from the refrigerator and, using a paring knife, trim the crust to about 1/2-inch wider than the pie dish.
• Fold the remaining excess crust under, so the fold is flush with the pie dish, and use your fingers to crimp the crust.
• Transfer the filling to the pie shell and dot with the butter.

CRUMBLE
• In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and salt.
• Add the butter and toss the mixture together with your hands.
• Break the butter into the flour mixture until the butter is the size of small pebbles and oat flakes, about 4 minutes.
• Sprinkle the crumble topping over the pie filling. Try to cover the apples completely or they can burn in the oven.
• Place the pie in the refrigerator while the oven preheats.
• Preheat the oven to 400 degrees; position the rack in the middle.
• Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.
• Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the edges are golden brown, the fruit bubbles lightly and the apples are cooked through.
• Let the pie cool for at least 1 hour before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
