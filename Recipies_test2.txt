Tunisian Chickpea Soup
https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020874-tunisian-chickpea-soup-lablabi

ingredients

FOR THE CRISPY CHICKPEAS:
1 can (15-ounce) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
1 teaspoon za’atar, plus more to taste

FOR THE SOUP:
1 can (15-ounce) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
2 bay leaves
1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
1/2 loaf hearty rustic bread (about 8 ounces)
1 cup chopped onion, from 1 medium onion
6 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated
1 tablespoon ground cumin, plus more for serving
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon harissa, plus more for serving
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, for serving
1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, for serving

instructions:

Prepare the crispy chickpeas:
• Transfer chickpeas to a rimmed baking sheet lined with a clean dish towel or paper towels.
• Cover with another towel (or paper towels) on top, rubbing gently to dry.
• Remove top towel and let air-dry for at least 1 hour.

Start preparing the soup:
• In a Dutch oven or heavy stockpot, combine chickpeas, 1 tablespoon olive oil, bay leaves and 1/2 teaspoon salt over high heat.
• Cook, stirring frequently, so the chickpeas sizzle and fry a bit in the spices and oil, until they’ve started to break down and get a little browned and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.
• Heat oven to 400 degrees. While chickpeas are cooking, cut bread into thick slices, then tear slices into bite-size pieces.
• Place bread in one layer on large rimmed baking sheet and toast until crisp and light brown, about 10 minutes.
• Let cool on pan and set aside.

Finish the crunchy chickpeas:
• Raise oven temperature to 425 degrees.
• Remove the towels from baking sheet with the chickpeas, and toss the chickpeas with 2 teaspoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and za’atar until well coated.
• Roast until golden and crispy, about 13 to 18 minutes, tossing halfway through. When chickpeas are still hot, sprinkle lightly more salt.
• Taste and add more salt or za’atar, or both, if you’d like.

Soup:
• When the chickpeas for the soup are tender, discard bay leaves.
• Using a slotted spoon, transfer 2 cups of chickpeas, 1/2 cup of chickpea cooking liquid and 1/4 cup olive oil to a blender or food processor, and purée until smooth. (Add the olive oil before puréeing.)
• In a large skillet over medium-high, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
• Add garlic and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon cumin and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.
• Add a splash of the chickpea cooking liquid to the pan, and bring to a simmer to deglaze, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Turn off heat.
• Add chickpea purée and onion mixture to soup, along with harissa and lemon juice, and stir well.
• Add a little water if soup seems too thick, and more salt, if needed.
• To serve, divide toasted bread pieces among soup bowls, then ladle in soup. Garnish with lemon zest, parsley, olive oil, more cumin and some of the crispy chickpeas — you’ll have leftovers.
• Serve hot, with more harissa on the side.




Creamy Braised White Beans and Chickpeas

ingredients:

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 head garlic, halved crosswise
1 cup whole milk
1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, with their liquid
1 (15-ounce) can white beans, such as cannellini or Great Northern, drained and rinsed
1 thyme sprig, 2 sage leaves or 1 bay leaf
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg, allspice or garam masala
Kosher salt and black pepper
Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving
Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving
Lemon slices (for squeezing lemon juice)
Arugula (add to bowls before serving)
Red-pepper flakes, for serving
4 slices crusty bread or thick toast

instructions:

• In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.
• Add the garlic, cut side down, and cook until golden brown, 1-2 minutes.
• Add the milk, chickpeas and their liquid, white beans, thyme and nutmeg and stir to combine. Season generously with salt and pepper.
• When the mixture begins to bubble around the edges of the pan (you don’t want it to come to a full boil), reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until it has thickened and tastes great to you, about 15-20 minutes.
• Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
• Use a fork to remove the garlic halves from the beans. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then use the fork to remove the cloves from the skins. Spread the cloves on bread or toast.
• Mash some of the beans using a potato masher or the back of a spoon.
• Add arugula or other greens to bowls, then ladle in beans and milk.
• Garnish with a drizzle of oil, a sprinkle of Parmesan and a pinch of red-pepper flakes and black pepper.
• Sprinkle with lemon juice.
• Serve with the bread alongside for dipping.
