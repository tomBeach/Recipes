• Heat the oil in a wide shallow pan with a lid.
• Throw in the onion rings and cook for 4-5 minutes until they begin to soften.

• Lift the fish from its marinade and nestle it in the pan among the onions and tomatoes.
• Pour over the marinade, 3 tbsp of water and the Angostura bitters, if you are using it.
• Cover the pan and gently cook for 6-8 minutes until the fish flakes easily and the onions are softened but still have some bite to them.
• Season with salt and pepper.
• Serve with basmati rice or boiled potatoes and steamed vegetables.





Morrocan Fish Stew

ingredients
1 large onion
1-inch piece ginger root
1 large clove garlic
1 1/4 pounds firm, skin-on white-fleshed fish fillets
1/4 cup sliced skin-on almonds
4 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
One 3-inch cinnamon stick
Pinch ground cayenne pepper
14 ounces canned, no-salt-added diced tomatoes
1 cup water
Sea salt
14 ounces canned, no-salt-added chickpeas
2 teaspoons honey
Freshly ground black pepper
Flat-leaf parsley, for garnish (may substitute cilantro)

instructions

• Cut the onion into very thin slices.
• Peel and mince the ginger. Crush the garlic.
• Use paper towels to pat the fish dry, then cut the fish into bite-size chunks that are on the large side.
• Heat a large, heavy-bottomed skillet (not cast-iron) over medium-low heat.
• Spread the almonds in the skillet; toast them for a few minutes, shaking the pan as needed, until they are fragrant and lightly browned. Transfer to a plate to cool.
• Return the skillet to the stove top; increase the heat to medium.
• Pour the oil into the skillet. Once it is heated, add the onion and stir to coat. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion becomes translucent, then add the garlic, ginger, cumin, turmeric and cinnamon stick. Stir to incorporate, then cook for 2 minutes, until fragrant.
• Add the cayenne pepper, tomatoes and their juices, the water and a pinch of the salt. Cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes.
• Gently stir in the fish. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, moving the fish around so it cooks evenly.
• Drain the chickpeas, then add to the skillet along with the honey. Season with the black pepper to taste; taste for salt and add accordingly. Discard the cinnamon stick.
• Garnish with the parsley leaves (chopped, if desired) and toasted almonds. Serve hot.

Baked Crab and Shrimp

ingredients
2 ribs celery
1 medium onion
1 medium red bell pepper
2 large cloves garlic
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
Large pinch ground cayenne pepper
Large pinch chili powder
2 teaspoons flour
1 cup fish or shrimp stock (may substitute clam juice)
8 ounces (1 cup) lump crabmeat
12 ounces peeled, deveined large raw shrimp (21-25 count)
2 to 3 tablespoons heavy cream
1 bunch scallions
1/2 cup plain fresh bread crumbs (may substitute plain panko)
1/2 lemon or lime

instructions

• Dice the celery, onion and red pepper.
• Mince the garlic.
• Melt the butter in a dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in the celery, onion, garlic and red pepper; cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, until the mixture has softened but not browned. (Reduce the heat as needed.)
• Sprinkle the pinches of cayenne pepper and chili powder over the mixture, and then the flour; cook for about 1 minute (so the flour loses its raw taste), stirring, until the vegetables are evenly coated.
• Gradually pour in the fish or shrimp stock as you continue to stir; increase the heat to medium-high to bring to a boil, stirring all the while. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the mixture has thickened into a sauce that pulls cleanly away from the bottom of the dutch oven when you pull a spatula through.
• Pick over the crab, discarding any bits of cartilage. Reduce the heat to medium-low; add the crabmeat and shrimp to the dutch oven, along with the heavy cream (to taste). Stir as you cook for about 2 minutes or until the shrimp becomes just opaque and the crab is warmed through.
• Meanwhile, position an oven rack 4 to 6 inches from the broiler element; preheat the broiler.
• Finely chop the white and light-green parts of the scallions, then combine them with the bread crumbs. Scatter over contents of the skillet, then transfer dutch oven to the oven; broil for less than 1 minute, watching closely, just until the crumbs have lightly browned.
• Squeeze the lemon or lime juice over the top. Serve right away.

 Cod & Potato Fritters

ingredients:

FRITTERS
2 T olive oil
1/2 pound cod
2 medium microwaved potatoes, mashed
1/2 onion, finely chopped
2 beaten eggs
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
salt and pepper (to taste)
1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped
1/4 cup beer (any kind is OK)
1 tsp baking powder
2 Tbsp all purpose flour
1 Tbsp all purpose flour (if needed)
2 cups of extra virgin spanish olive oil

RED PEPPER SAUCE
1 red pepper
3/4 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 small shallot, roughly chopped
1/4 cup vegetable stock
½ tsp sugar, to taste (optional)
salt and pepper (to taste)

instructions
FRITTERS
• Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cod, season with salt and pepper; cook until just barely opaque and flakey.
• In a medium bowl place cod, potatoes, onion, eggs, garlic, salt, pepper and parsley. Mix well.
• Add beer, baking powder and flour, 2 Tbsp first and if the mix is too light to handle it, then add the other Tbsp. Mixture should be very similar to muffin dough, thick and able to maintain its shape when rounded with a tablespoon.
• Let it rest for at least 1/2 hour so the fritters become tastier, fluffy and lighter when fried.
• Heat the olive oil in a deep pan as fritters should be able to "swim" in the oil.
• When oil is hot but not smoking, pour the mixture by heaping tablespoons into the pan and let it fry for about 2 minutes on each side until golden and puffy.
• Drain on paper towel and serve immediately.

RED PEPPER SAUCE
• Heat oven to 350.
• Place the pepper on a baking tray and roast in the oven for about 45 mins until the skins are blackened.
• Roughly chop the red flesh.
• Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. When hot, fry the garlic and shallot for a few mins.
• Add the chopped peppers and continue to fry for a few mins, stirring to combine everything.
• Add the vegetable stock, bring to the boil, then allow it to reduce a little.
• Pour the contents of the pan into a blender.  Season with salt and pepper, then whizz until smooth. Adjust the seasoning to taste.
• Depending on the ripeness of the peppers, you shouldn’t need any sugar – but if they retain a slightly bitter flavour, return the sauce to the pan, add sugar to taste and let it dissolve over the heat.
• Serve hot or at room temperature.
