Spiced Chickpea Stew With Coconut and Turmeric
ingredients
¼ cup olive oil, plus more for serving
4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 (2-inch) piece ginger, finely chopped
 Kosher salt and black pepper
1 ½ teaspoons ground turmeric, plus more for serving
1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 (15-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk
2 cups vegetable or chicken stock
1 bunch Swiss chard, stems removed, torn into bite-size pieces
1 cup mint leaves, for serving
 Yogurt, for serving (optional)
 Toasted pita, lavash or other flatbread, for serving (optional)

instructions
• Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large pot over medium.
• Add garlic, onion and ginger. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is translucent and starts to brown a little at the edges, 3 to 5 minutes.
• Add 1 1/2 teaspoons turmeric, 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, and the chickpeas, and season with salt and pepper.
• Cook, stirring frequently, so the chickpeas sizzle and fry a bit in the spices and oil, until they’ve started to break down and get a little browned and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.
• Remove about a cup of chickpeas and set aside for garnish.
• Using a wooden spoon or spatula, further crush the remaining chickpeas slightly to release their starchy insides. (This will help thicken the stew.)
• Add coconut milk and stock, and season with salt and pepper.
• Bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits that have formed on the bottom of the pot.
• Cook, stirring occasionally, until stew has thickened, 30 to 35 minutes.
• Add greens and stir, making sure they’re submerged in the liquid. Cook until they wilt and soften, 3 to 5 minutes, depending on what you’re using.
• Season again with salt and pepper.
• Divide among bowls and top with mint, reserved chickpeas, a sprinkle of red-pepper flakes and a good drizzle of olive oil.
• Serve alongside yogurt and toasted pita if using; dust the yogurt with turmeric if you'd like.

4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced

Navy bean soup with sausage & spinach
ingredients
1 cup soaked navy beans	[soak overnight in frig]
1/2 Tbsp olive oil
7 oz smoked sausage
1/2 medium onion
1 cloves garlic
2 carrots
2 stalks celery
1 whole bay leaf
1 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp dried rosemary
freshly cracked pepper
4 cups water				[boil 2 hours]
1 1/2 T butter
1 1/2 T flour
2 cups fresh baby spinach
1/4 Tbsp salt
1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar

instructions:
• Place the beans in a bowl, cover them with cool water, then put in the refrigerator to soak over night.  (NOTE: 1/2 cup dry => 1 cup soaked)
• Slice the sausage into medallions and add them to dutch oven with olive oil.
• Saute the sausage over medium heat until it is nicely browned (about 5 minutes).
• While the sausage is browning, dice the onion, carrot, and celery into small pieces, and mince the garlic.
• Drain off the excess fat, then add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic.
• Saute for about 5 minutes more. The moisture released by the vegetables will dissolve any browned bits off of the bottom of the pot.
• Drain the soaked beans and give them a good rinse with fresh water.
• Add the rinsed beans to the pot along with the bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, some freshly cracked pepper, and 4 cups of water.  Stir everything to combine.
• Turn the heat up to high and allow the soup to come up to a full boil.
• Once it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and boil for 2 hours (lid on), stirring occasionally.  (Beans will be falling apart when done.)
• Melt butter in small saucepan on low and whisk in flour to make a roux.
• After gently boiling for a couple of hours, mix in roux to thicken.  Use a wooden spoon to smash some of the beans against the side of the pot to thicken more.
• Stir in the fresh spinach until wilted.
• Season the soup with salt. Start with just a 1/4 teaspoon at a time and add more until it is to your desired saltiness (I used 1/4 tablespoon total).
• Lastly, stir in the apple cider vinegar. Serve hot.
