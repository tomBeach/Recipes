3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil (plus more for serving)
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 pounds ground "meatloaf mix" (ground beef and pork)
3/4 cup dried Italian style bread crumbs (such as Progresso)
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (plus more for serving)

Marinara sauce
1 28-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes, certified D.O.P. if possible
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
7 garlic cloves, peeled and slivered
crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large fresh basil sprig, or 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, more to taste

1 pound spaghetti

instructions
• Preheat the oven to 350°F.
• In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic and water.
• Add the meat, breadcrumbs and cheese and mix until just combined (your hands are the best tool). Do not overwork it.
• Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs and place on an ungreased baking sheet.
• Bake for about 10 minutes, then remove the baking sheet from oven and use a metal spatula to turn the meatballs (they will stick a bit but should release easily when you scrape under them with the spatula).
• Put the meatballs back in the oven and cook for another 10 minutes, until they are nicely browned and almost cooked through.
• Make marinara sauce.
• Transfer the browned meatballs to the marinara sauce, leaving the fat behind.
• Cover loosely with a lid or foil and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the flavors marry and the meatballs are cooked through. Keep warm until ready to toss with pasta.
• While the meatballs are simmering, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
• Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente.
• Drain, then toss with the sauce and meatballs (you may find it easier to toss everything together in the pasta pot rather than the skillet; it depends on the sizes of pans you are using.).
• Serve topped with fresh basil and more grated cheese.


• Pour tomatoes into a large bowl and crush with your hands. Pour 1 cup water into can and slosh it around to get tomato juices. Reserve.
• In a large skillet (do not use a deep pot) over medium heat, heat the oil. When it is hot, add garlic.
• As soon as garlic is sizzling (do not let it brown), add the tomatoes, then the reserved tomato water.
• Add whole chile or red pepper flakes, oregano (if using) and salt. Stir.
• Place basil sprig, including stem, on the surface (like a flower). Let it wilt, then submerge in sauce.
• Simmer sauce until thickened and oil on surface is a deep orange, about 15 minutes. (If using oregano, taste sauce after 10 minutes of simmering, adding more salt and oregano as needed.)
• Discard basil and chile (if using).

Ikea’s Swedish meatballs

ingredients

FOR THE MEATBALLS
1 pound ground beef
8 ounces ground pork
1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed or minced
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
1 large egg, lightly whisked
1/3 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon fine sea salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

FOR THE SAUCE
5 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups beef broth
3/4 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

instructions
• Shape the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the beef and pork, mixing with your fingers to break up any lumps. Add the onion, garlic, bread crumbs and egg, and gently mix to combine. Add the milk, salt and pepper and mix to combine.

Shape the mixture into 2-inch balls. Place on a clean platter, cover and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 45 minutes.

Step 2

Make the sauce: Just before you begin frying the meatballs, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the flour and stir it into the butter until a roux forms, continue to cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

Slowly add the broth, stirring until just combined.

Add the cream, soy sauce and mustard and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then turn the heat to low and let the sauce thicken, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover and set aside.

Step 3

Cook the meatballs: When ready to cook the meatballs, place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.

In an ovenproof large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Working in batches to avoid crowding, add the meatballs and cook until browned on the outside, about 8 minutes. Transfer the browned meatballs to a plate and repeat with the remaining meatballs.

Return the meatballs to the skillet and pour the sauce over. Cover the skillet with a lid or foil, and transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through.

Serve the meatballs as they are or with boiled or mashed potatoes.

 Classic Caribbean Beef Pelau

ingredients
3 lbs beef
2 scallions (chopped)
4 sprigs thyme
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 med onion (diced)
1 large tomato (diced)
3 cloves garlic (crushed)
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3/4 tablespoon salt
3 cups long grain par-boil rice
1 can coconut milk (about 1.5 cups)
2 cups water – adjust
1 large carrot (diced)
1 can pigeon peas (drain, rinsed)
3 small white habanero peppers
1 tablespoon veg oil
1 1/2 tablespoon golden brown sugar

instructions
• Cut the pieces of beef into thin strips (I used a cheap cut of beef) and season with the salt, black pepper, scallions, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, parsley, tomato, onion, garlic, hot pepper and ketchup.
• Stir well and allow to marinate for at least 2 hours in the fridge.
• In a heavy / dry pot, heat the veg oil on a medium flame, then add the brown sugar.
• Make sure the pot is dry, as well as the spoon you’ll be using. I’d recommend using a spoon with a long handle. You may need to turn the fan on above your stove or open your kitchen windows as it can become a bit smoky.
• Turn the heat up to high (please have the seasoned beef close) and stir the sugar. It will melt, go frothy, then amber in color (like the edges in the pic below). You want all the sugar to go amber and NOT black. If it goes black you’ve gone too far.. STOP.
• As you achieve that amber color.. carefully add the seasoned beef to the pot and stir well.
• After you’ve stirred it well, cover the pot and bring it to a boil. After it comes to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover the pot and allow it to cook for about 30 minutes. Yes, you will be required to stir it every 5-10 mins and it will spring it’s own juices.
• After 30 minutes or so, turn the heat up to med/high, remove the lid and burn off all the liquid that’s left. We’ll achieve two things.. intensify the beef with the ‘stewed’ flavor and we’ll get a lovely dark color which will help ‘color’ the finished dish.
• In the same bowl you marinated the beef, pour in the water and mix around to pick up any remaining marinade (we’ll need it soon).  Stir the beef well as the liquid burns off so it’s doesn’t burn.
• When you can see the veg oil we started off with, add the rinsed pigeon peas, diced carrots and coconut milk. Stir and bring to a boil
• It’s now time to wash your rice and add it to the pot. Basically all you have to do is place the rice in a deep bowl, cover with water and massage with your fingers/hands. The water will go cloudy. Drain off that water and repeat that process until the water in the bowl is relatively clear.
• Now add the water from the bowl (where the beef was marinated) and bring to a boil (stir).
• As it comes to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cover and allow it to cook until the rice is fully plump and all the liquid is burnt off. Taste for salt near the end and adjust accordingly. I’d recommend leaving the lid on the pot for about 10 minutes after you turn off the stove. Also, you can have the Pelau be grainy (as in this version) or add a bit more water to the pot if you like your pelau a bit more ‘soupy’.
• If you have celery or extra parsley, I’d recommend adding a bit (diced fine) after you turn off the stove. Then after the 10 minutes of ‘resting’, stir in.
• Serve with a side of coleslaw, Tomato Choka and/or Pepper Choka.. don’t forget a thick slice of Avocado!
• Remember to cut the pieces of beef small so it’s fork tender when the pelau is done cooking.

Lemon Garlic Chicken Recipe

Ingredients:

20 oz or 4 chicken thighs, deboned but skin on
Sliced lemon, for garnishing

Marinade:

3 cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon chili flakes
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, optional
Pinch of salt
3 dashes ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped Parsley leaves

Method:

Debone the chicken thighs but keep the skin on. If you like skinless, you may buy skinless and boneless skin thighs.

Mix all the ingredients in the Marinade in a bowl, whisk to combine well. Marinate the chicken with the Marinade, in a bowl or in a plastic bag for 30 minutes, or best for 2 hours.

Fire up the grill and grill the chicken on both sides, until it’s cooked through and the skin is charred. You may bake the chicken in an oven at 400F for about 15-20 minutes, or pan-fried on a skillet on medium to low heat. Serve the chicken warm with some lemon wedges.
