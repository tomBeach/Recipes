https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021571-maple-pecan-galette-with-fresh-ginger

ingredients
DOUGH
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
10 tablespoons cold unsalted butter (1 1/4 stick), cut into 1-inch cubes

FILLING
1 1/2 cups whole pecans, lightly toasted (see Note)
3/4 cup maple sugar (or use brown sugar)
6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 stick), cut into 1-inch cubes
1 large egg, at room temperature, beaten
1 tablespoon bourbon, brandy or rum
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
 Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling
 Whipped cream or ice cream, for serving

instructions
DOUGH
• Crack the egg into a measuring cup and beat it with a fork.
• Add enough cold water to measure 1/3 cup.
• Transfer 1 tablespoon of the egg mixture to a small covered container and reserve it in the refrigerator for brushing the crust before baking.
• To make the dough in a food processor, combine the flour, sugar and salt in the work bowl and pulse two or three times to combine.
• Add cubed butter, then pulse until the mixture has formed lima bean-size pieces.
• Drizzle in the egg mixture and pulse just to combine, taking care not overprocess.
• Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and squeeze it once or twice to form a ball. (Add a few drops of water if needed to help the dough come together.)
• Flatten into a disk, cover in plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.

FILLING
• Set aside 1/2 cup pecans for the topping.
• Put remaining 1 cup pecans in a food processor with the sugar and process until finely ground. (If you’ve made the crust in a food processor, don’t bother washing it out.)
• Pulse in the butter, egg, bourbon, vanilla, ginger, allspice and fine sea salt until smooth.
• Chill for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days, until the mixture is cold and solid.
• Place a piece of parchment paper on a work surface.
• Unwrap the dough and place it in the center of the paper.
• Top with another piece of parchment paper. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into an 11-inch round. (It can be ragged at the edges.)
• Leaving the dough sandwiched in the parchment paper, transfer it to a rimmed baking sheet.
• Remove the top piece of parchment paper from the dough.
• Spoon the pecan mixture onto the dough circle, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border.
• Top with reserved whole pecans.
• Gently fold the pastry over the filling, pleating to hold it in. (Casual folds are fine: The aim is to make sure the filling stays in the tart.)
• Put the galette, uncovered, in the refrigerator for another 20 minutes (and up to 1 hour). It should be cold and firm to the touch when you put it in the oven.
• As the galette chills, heat the oven to 375 degrees.
• Brush pastry with reserved egg mixture. (Add a little water if it thickened as it sat.)
• Sprinkle the pastry very lightly with flaky sea salt and very generously with maple sugar.
• Bake the galette for 25 to 35 minutes, until the crust is golden brown.
• Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting.
• Serve warm or at room temperature, with ice cream.

Tarte Tatin
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/02/12/the-upside-to-tarte-tatin-its-not-as-hard-to-make-as-you-think/

ingredients
1 recipe pie dough
8 large Golden Delicious apples
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 cup granulated sugar
Vanilla ice cream

instructions
FILLING
• Use a vegetable peeler to peel the apples. Cut the apples in half from top to bottom through their core. Using a melon baller, scoop out the seeds from each half. Using a small sharp knife, trim away any core or stem.
• In an ovenproof 10-inch, stainless steel — nonstick or not — high-sided skillet, over medium-low heat, melt the butter.
• Turn off the heat and sprinkle the sugar over the melted butter, letting it completely absorb, until it looks like wet sand.
• Arrange 13 apple halves, stem side down, atop the sugar and butter in a circle at the perimeter of the pan. Apples should be nestled very tightly together.
• Fit the remaining three apple halves into the center.
• Over medium-low heat, bring the mixture to a rapid simmer for about 5 minutes.
• Turn the heat to very low, and cook, rotating the pan occasionally, for 60 to 70 minutes. (Within the first 10 minutes of cooking, the apples will begin to shrink.)
• This is when you can wiggle any additional pieces into the pan.) Keep an eye on the apples as they cook. They will release their juices as the sugar begins to caramelize. Lower the heat further if the juices start to bubble up over the side of the pan.
• As the apples shrink, with a spoon or spatula, coax them to lean on one another, as this will produce a prettier tart once inverted.

CRUST
• Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the pie dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.
• Take the skillet you will cook the apples in and place it upside down on the pastry, then use a sharp knife to cut around the perimeter of the skillet.
• Refrigerate the circle of dough until ready to use.
• After about 1 hour, the apples will have shrunk significantly.
• Using a fork or tongs, gently pluck one out to check the color. The parts of the apples that were in contact with the pan should be between toasted hazelnut and deep chestnut in color. Turn off the heat, and cool slightly, at least 30 minutes.
• Place the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.
• Retrieve the dough from the refrigerator and gently lay it over the apples.
• Place the skillet on a large, rimmed baking sheet and put it in the oven. Bake the tart 35 to 40 minutes, until the pastry is the color of almond skin.
• Let the tart cool in the pan for 1 to 2 minutes.
• Place a plate that’s slightly larger than the skillet on top, ensuring that the rim clears the edge of the skillet on all sides.
• Using oven mitts, grip the pan in one hand and plate in the other and, over a sink, quickly and carefully flip the hot skillet — away from you — so the tart inverts onto the plate.  The tart may have shifted in its descent; use a spoon to nudge the apples back into formation.
• Let cool for at least 20 minutes, then serve as is, or with vanilla ice cream, creme fraiche, creme anglaise or caramel sauce.

Light Flaky Pastry Crust

ingredients
3 cups flour, plus more for dusting	1 1/2 c
1/4 cup sugar	1/8 c
1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt	3/4 t
16 Tbsp (2 sticks) unsalted butter (frozen, cubed)	8 Tbsp
1 Tbsp ice water	1/2 Tbsp
1/4 cup vodka or gin	1/8 c

instructions
• Combine the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor and whir to blend.
• Scatter the pieces of butter over the flour; pulse in long spurts until the butter is well incorporated. This could take a dozen or more pulses.
• Add the water and vodka a little at time, processing after each addition. Stop when you have moist clumps and curds (you might not need all the liquid to reach this point); pinch some of the dough and it should hold together easily.
• Turn the dough out, divide it in half and shape each half into a disk
• If the dough is still very cold, you can roll it immediately; if not, wrap the disks and refrigerate them for 30 minutes.

Chocolate Mousse Cake
https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/chocolate-mousse-cake/16997/?utm_term=.6835efc7a524

CAKE
6 large eggs, separated into yolks and whites, at room temperature
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped and melted
3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 tablespoons cake flour

MOUSSE
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped, melted and kept lukewarm
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (optional)

GANACHE
10 ounces bittersweet or dark chocolate chopped
1 3/4 cups heavy cream
About 1 cup chocolate sprinkles (optional)

instructions
CAKE
• Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
• Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet with cooking oil spray, then line the bottom with parchment paper.
• Combine the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of the sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer or use a handheld electric mixer; beat on medium-high speed, until light, thick and fluffy, for about 5 minutes. The mixture should nearly triple in volume and fall off the beaters in a thick ribbon.
• Add the vanilla extract; beating on medium-high speed, then add all the melted/cooled bittersweet chocolate, and beat until just incorporated.
• Beat the egg whites in a separate, clean bowl using the balloon-whisk attachment on your stand mixer or with the handheld electric mixer on medium-high speed; once they are foamy, add the cream of tartar.
• Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until soft peaks form.
• Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.
• Gently fold a small amount of beaten egg whites into the egg yolk-chocolate mixture, to loosen it up.
• Fold in a third of the remaining beaten egg whites (some white streaks can remain), then sift in a tablespoon of the cake flour and gently fold to incorporate.
• Repeat with the remaining beaten egg whites and the remaining tablespoon of cake flour until everything is just incorporated.
• Transfer the batter to the baking sheet, trying not to deflate it. Use an offset spatula to spread it evenly into the corners.
• Bake (middle rack) for 17 minutes, until the top of the cake springs back when lightly pressed. The cake should be a light brown, similar in color to brown sugar.
• Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely.

MOUSSE
• Combine the egg whites and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a balloon-whisk attachment or use a handheld electric mixer; beat on medium-high speed until soft peaks form.
• Gradually add the sugar, beating until glossy, soft peaks form.
• Beat the heavy whipping cream in a separate clean bowl (using your stand mixer fitted with a balloon-whisk attachment or a handheld electric mixer) until soft peaks form.
• By hand, fold half the lukewarm chocolate into the whipped cream with a spatula until incorporated, then fold in the remaining chocolate to form a smooth, homogenous mixture.
• Gently fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate whipped cream until just blended, then fold in the remaining beaten egg whites. Gently fold in the mini chocolate chips or chopped chocolate, if using.
• Cover and refrigerate the mousse until chilled, but no longer than 30 minutes, or the mousse may become too stiff to work with.

GANACHE
• Place the 10 ounces of bittersweet or dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl.
• Heat the heavy cream in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, just until bubbles form at the edges.
• Immediately pour over the chocolate; let the mixture sit for a minute or two, then whisk to form a smooth, glossy ganache. Let it cool for a bit while you begin the cake assembly.
• Invert the cake slab onto a cutting board and discard its parchment paper. Cut the cake into 3 rectangles of equal size.
• Place one portion on a large serving platter or plate. Use a piping bag or offset spatula to spread half the chilled mousse on the bottom cake layer.
• Next, stack another portion of cake on the mousse layer, pressing it lightly in place without forcing out any of the mousse below.
• Follow with the remaining mousse, then top with the remaining cake portion, again pressing it lightly in place.
• Use an offset spatula to spread the slightly cooled ganache over the top and sides of the cake, keeping things neat.
• If desired, press handfuls of the chocolate sprinkles against the sides of the cake (or decorate as you wish).
• Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to overnight.
• Let the cake come to room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

Almond Meringues with Creme Anglaise
http://www.thehungryhounds.com/blog/2015/4/26/almond-meringues-with-creme-anglaise-and-berry-sauce-ile-flottante

ingredients
CREME ANGLAISE
5 egg yolks
1/3 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/4 cups milk (we used 1%)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

ALMOND MERINGUES
2 1/2 egg whites
pinch (1/16 teaspoon) cream of tartar
1/8 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup sliced almonds

instructions
CREME ANGLAISE
• Set up a metal bowl in ice water bath (for cooling milk pot).
• Separate the egg yolks from the whites.  Reserve the egg whites in the refrigerator for the meringues.
• In a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks, sugar and salt for 2-3 minutes on high (runny deep yellow => thick light yellow).
• In a medium pot, heat the milk over low heat (bubbles around edge but do not boil!).
• With the mixer running at low, ladle 1/4 of the warm milk into the yolk mixture, allowing the mixer to whisk the whole time.  Then add another 1/4 ladle while whisking.  (This tempers the eggs so you don't end up with sweet scrambled eggs.)
• Scrape the yolk and milk mixture back into the pot with the remaining warm milk, whisking constantly to combine.
• Add the vanilla, turn the heat to medium, and continue whisking until the mixture is thickened (3-5 minutes) and coats back of spoon.  (Do not allow the mixture to boil!)
• Remove from heat, pour into chilled bowl in ice water, and give it a couple of gentle swirls.  (If the sauce has curdled slightly, use immersion blender until curds just disappear.)
• Refrigerate the creme anglaise sauce until ready to use, with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming.

BERRY SAUCE
• Puree the mixed berries until smooth.  Refrigerate.

ALMOND MERINGUES
• Preheat oven to 350.
• Line a baking dish with parchment.
• In a stand mixer, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on high for about 2 minutes until medium peaks form: (dip the beater, pull straight up, turn upside down: tip is firm but still curls over).
• Add the almond extract and sugar.  Continue beating on high for an additional 1-2 minutes until stiff peaks have formed: (repeat the process above: peaks stick straight up).
• Gently stir in sliced almonds.
• Pour the beaten whites into a large ziplock bag and cut off the tip to make an improvised piping bag.  Create 2" mounds on paper spaced adequately for separation.
• Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden.
• Cool for ten minutes.
• Grease a spatula and carefully remove the meringues from the baking sheet (they will be sticky).
• Serve the almond meringues surrounded by a puddle of creme anglaise sauce, fresh berries and a drizzle of berry sauce.
• Serve immediately and store leftovers separately.
