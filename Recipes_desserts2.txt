Tiramisu

https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018684-classic-tiramisu

Ingredients
LADYFINGERS:
3 large egg yokes (room temperature)
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
4 large egg whites (room temperature)
1/4 cup sugar
1 cup (5oz/142g) all-purpose flour
powdered sugar for dusting (optional)

CREAM:
4 large egg yolks
1/2 cup granulated sugar, divided
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 cup mascarpone (8 ounces)
1 3/4 cups good espresso or very strong coffee
2 tablespoons rum or cognac
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

ASSEMBLY:
24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce package)
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 to 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving

Instructions
LADYFINGERS:
• Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
• Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper, set aside.

• Separate the eggs, placing the yolks in a large bowl and the whites in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.

• Using a large whisk or hand mixer, whip the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar, until pale and fluffy, then beat in the vanilla. Set aside.

• Whip the egg whites on medium-high speed, until fluffy (3 minutes). Once light and fluffy add the other 1/4 cup of the sugar in a slow and steady stream while whipping. Continue to whip until the whites hold stiff peaks (2 minutes)

• Using a large metal spoon, gently fold in the whipped whites, taking care not to deflate all of the air you have incorporated.
• Once the egg white mixture and yolk mixture are almost combined sift the flour over the batter.
• Continue to gently fold until all of the flour is incorporated.
• Fill a large piping bag with the batter and pipe the batter in 3 1/2 inch long lines about 1 inch apart.
• Bake for 14-15 minutes, or until just beginning to turn golden around the edges.
• Allow to cool fully before storing in an airtight container.

CREAM:
• Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl.
• Transfer mixture to a large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.
• In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining 1/4 cup sugar until it creates soft-medium peaks.
• Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.
• Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.
• Using a sifter, dust the bottom of an 8x8-inch dish with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.

• Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture. NOTE: they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish.
• Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.).
• Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer.
• Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.
• Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired.
• Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better) before slicing or scooping to serve.

ingredients
CAKE
6 large eggs, separated into yolks and whites, at room temperature
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped and melted
3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 tablespoons cake flour

MOUSSE
4 large egg whites, at room temperature
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped, melted and kept lukewarm
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (optional)

GANACHE
10 ounces bittersweet or dark chocolate chopped
1 3/4 cups heavy cream
About 1 cup chocolate sprinkles (optional)

instructions
CAKE
• Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
• Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet with cooking oil spray, then line the bottom with parchment paper.
• Combine the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of the sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer or use a handheld electric mixer; beat on medium-high speed, until light, thick and fluffy, for about 5 minutes. The mixture should nearly triple in volume and fall off the beaters in a thick ribbon.
• Add the vanilla extract; beating on medium-high speed, then add all the melted/cooled bittersweet chocolate, and beat until just incorporated.
• Beat the egg whites in a separate, clean bowl using the balloon-whisk attachment on your stand mixer or with the handheld electric mixer on medium-high speed; once they are foamy, add the cream of tartar.
• Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until soft peaks form.
• Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.
• Gently fold a small amount of beaten egg whites into the egg yolk-chocolate mixture, to loosen it up.
• Fold in a third of the remaining beaten egg whites (some white streaks can remain), then sift in a tablespoon of the cake flour and gently fold to incorporate.
• Repeat with the remaining beaten egg whites and the remaining tablespoon of cake flour until everything is just incorporated.
• Transfer the batter to the baking sheet, trying not to deflate it. Use an offset spatula to spread it evenly into the corners.
• Bake (middle rack) for 17 minutes, until the top of the cake springs back when lightly pressed. The cake should be a light brown, similar in color to brown sugar.
• Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely.

MOUSSE
• Combine the egg whites and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a balloon-whisk attachment or use a handheld electric mixer; beat on medium-high speed until soft peaks form.
• Gradually add the sugar, beating until glossy, soft peaks form.
• Beat the heavy whipping cream in a separate clean bowl (using your stand mixer fitted with a balloon-whisk attachment or a handheld electric mixer) until soft peaks form.
• By hand, fold half the lukewarm chocolate into the whipped cream with a spatula until incorporated, then fold in the remaining chocolate to form a smooth, homogenous mixture.
• Gently fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate whipped cream until just blended, then fold in the remaining beaten egg whites. Gently fold in the mini chocolate chips or chopped chocolate, if using.
• Cover and refrigerate the mousse until chilled, but no longer than 30 minutes, or the mousse may become too stiff to work with.

GANACHE
• Place the 10 ounces of bittersweet or dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl.
• Heat the heavy cream in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, just until bubbles form at the edges.
• Immediately pour over the chocolate; let the mixture sit for a minute or two, then whisk to form a smooth, glossy ganache. Let it cool for a bit while you begin the cake assembly.
• Invert the cake slab onto a cutting board and discard its parchment paper. Cut the cake into 3 rectangles of equal size.
• Place one portion on a large serving platter or plate. Use a piping bag or offset spatula to spread half the chilled mousse on the bottom cake layer.
• Next, stack another portion of cake on the mousse layer, pressing it lightly in place without forcing out any of the mousse below.
• Follow with the remaining mousse, then top with the remaining cake portion, again pressing it lightly in place.
• Use an offset spatula to spread the slightly cooled ganache over the top and sides of the cake, keeping things neat.
• If desired, press handfuls of the chocolate sprinkles against the sides of the cake (or decorate as you wish).
• Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to overnight.
• Let the cake come to room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
