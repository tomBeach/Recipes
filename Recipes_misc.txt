Corn Pancakes

ingredients
2 cups ll-purpose flour
Pinch of kosher salt
1 stick unsalted butter, cut into thumbnail cubes
1/2 cup ice-cold water
1 pound yellow onions
1 strip bacon
1 large egg
1/2 cup heavy cream
Freshly ground black pepper
Freshly grated nutmeg

instructions
• Blend flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor.
• Scatter butter over flour and pulse 12 times (coarse meal consistency)
• Dump butter-flour mixture into a medium stainless bowl.
• Make a well in the center and pour ice-cold water into the well.
• Using a flexible plastic dough scraper instead of your warm hands, bring the dough together by folding and pressing.
• Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.
• Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
• Meanwhile, cut the onions in half and peel them.
• Julienne the halves (root end to sprout end).
• In a wide sauté pan over medium-low heat, fry the bacon and onions until they are caramelized (25 minutes) for slow caramelization.
• Set onions aside to cool.
• Roll tart dough out to a 1/4-inch-thick round, and drape over a round 10-inch fluted false-bottom tart pan. Roll the pin across the pan to cut off the excess dough.
• Dock the bottom of the dough with the tines of a fork, weight the pastry with beans or weight and bake for 25 minutes.
• In a bowl, beat the egg with the cream.
• Stir in the caramelized onions.
• Season with pepper, nutmeg and salt to taste. Make sure the onions are all evenly coated with the custard.
• Remove tart shell from oven, and slip it onto a baking sheet.
• Remove weights, fill with the onion-custard mixture and distribute it evenly.
• Return tart to oven on the sheet, and bake for 25 minutes, or until custard has set, the tops of the onions start to achieve a deeper brown and the dough is dark golden brown at the edges.
• Remove from the ring, and allow to cool just a few minutes on the rack, so that the piping hot tart shell can kind of tighten up enough to be sliced with a sharp chef’s knife.
• Cut into wedges, and serve while hot.
