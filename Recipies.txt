Tunisian Chickpea Soup
https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020874-tunisian-chickpea-soup-lablabi

ingredients:

FOR THE CRISPY CHICKPEAS:
1 can (15-ounce) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
1 teaspoon za’atar, plus more to taste

FOR THE SOUP:
1 can (15-ounce) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
2 bay leaves
1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
1/2 loaf hearty rustic bread (about 8 ounces)
1 cup chopped onion, from 1 medium onion
6 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated
1 tablespoon ground cumin, plus more for serving
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon harissa, plus more for serving
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, for serving
1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, for serving

instructions:

Prepare the crispy chickpeas:
• Transfer chickpeas to a rimmed baking sheet lined with a clean dish towel or paper towels.
• Cover with another towel (or paper towels) on top, rubbing gently to dry.
• Remove top towel and let air-dry for at least 1 hour.

Start preparing the soup:
• In a Dutch oven or heavy stockpot, combine chickpeas, 1 tablespoon olive oil, bay leaves and 1/2 teaspoon salt over high heat.
• Cook, stirring frequently, so the chickpeas sizzle and fry a bit in the spices and oil, until they’ve started to break down and get a little browned and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.
• Heat oven to 400 degrees. While chickpeas are cooking, cut bread into thick slices, then tear slices into bite-size pieces.
• Place bread in one layer on large rimmed baking sheet and toast until crisp and light brown, about 10 minutes.
• Let cool on pan and set aside.

Finish the crunchy chickpeas:
• Raise oven temperature to 425 degrees.
• Remove the towels from baking sheet with the chickpeas, and toss the chickpeas with 2 teaspoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and za’atar until well coated.
• Roast until golden and crispy, about 13 to 18 minutes, tossing halfway through. When chickpeas are still hot, sprinkle lightly more salt.
• Taste and add more salt or za’atar, or both, if you’d like.

Soup:
• When the chickpeas for the soup are tender, discard bay leaves.
• Using a slotted spoon, transfer 2 cups of chickpeas, 1/2 cup of chickpea cooking liquid and 1/4 cup olive oil to a blender or food processor, and purée until smooth. (Add the olive oil before puréeing.)
• In a large skillet over medium-high, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
• Add garlic and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon cumin and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.
• Add a splash of the chickpea cooking liquid to the pan, and bring to a simmer to deglaze, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Turn off heat.
• Add chickpea purée and onion mixture to soup, along with harissa and lemon juice, and stir well.
• Add a little water if soup seems too thick, and more salt, if needed.
• To serve, divide toasted bread pieces among soup bowls, then ladle in soup. Garnish with lemon zest, parsley, olive oil, more cumin and some of the crispy chickpeas — you’ll have leftovers.
• Serve hot, with more harissa on the side.

• Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
• Use a fork to remove the garlic halves from the beans. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then use the fork to remove the cloves from the skins. Spread the cloves on bread or toast.

Crispy Spiced Cauliflower Steaks
cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020168-crispy-spiced-cauliflower-steaks

ingredients:

1/2 cinnamon stick, broken up
2  teaspoons coriander seeds
2  teaspoons fennel seeds
1  teaspoon black peppercorns
1  teaspoon cumin seeds
4  cloves
Large pinch of ground cayenne
2  tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus additional, as needed
1 1/3 cups brown- or white-rice flour (about 7 1/3 ounces)
2/3 cup tapioca flour (about 3 2/3 ounces)
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (from 2 limes)
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 1 large lemon), plus additional lemon wedges, for serving
1  tablespoon grated fresh turmeric (or 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric)
2  small heads cauliflower (about 1 pound each), leaves removed, cut from top to core into 1/2-inch-thick slices
1 1/2 cup coconut oil
1  cup Greek yogurt, for serving (optional)
2  tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, for serving (optional)

instructions:

• Line a baking sheet with a wire rack or paper towels, and set aside.
• Finely grind cinnamon, coriander, fennel, peppercorns, cumin and cloves in a spice grinder, spice mill or mortar and pestle.
• Transfer to a bowl, and stir in cayenne and 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons salt. Set aside.
• In a large bowl, whisk both flours until combined.
• Whisk in lime and lemon juices, then gradually whisk in enough water until the mixture is the consistency of thin pancake batter (about 1 1/3 cups).
• Stir in turmeric and the spice mixture. Taste, and adjust salt as needed.
• Working with 1 or 2 steaks at a time, push the cauliflower steaks into the batter, turn to coat and allow to marinate for at least 3 minutes.
• Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium high.
• Add coconut oil to a depth of 1/3-inch, and heat until hot.
• Carefully drip a few drops of batter into the oil to test that it’s sufficiently hot. The batter should immediately sizzle and expand.
• Slip the steaks one at a time directly from the batter into the pan. Don’t overcrowd the pan — the steaks should never touch.
• Cook until golden brown on the bottom, 8 to 12 minutes, rotating the steaks around the pan after 6 to 8 minutes to ensure even browning.
• Use a thin metal spatula to carefully flip the steaks.
• Continue cooking until the second sides are golden-brown and the cores are tender when pierced with a knife, 4 to 6 minutes.
• Transfer steaks to the prepared baking sheet, and allow to drain.
• Season with salt.

Vegetarian Mapo Tofu

ingredients:

1 ounce (about 12) dried shiitake mushrooms
1 cup warm water
2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons chili bean paste
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine (may substitute dry sherry)
2 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground Sichuan pepper, or more as needed
2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil
1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons black bean sauce
3 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal, white and green parts separated
2 cloves garlic, minced
1-inch piece peeled fresh ginger root, minced (1 teaspoon)
1 block tofu (soft, medium or firm; about 1 pound), drained and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon cornstarch, dissolved in 2 tablespoons water

instructions:

• Combine the shiitake mushrooms and cup of warm water in a mixing bowl.
• Soak for 15-20 minutes, then lift out the mushrooms and transfer to a cutting board, squeezing as much moisture out of them as you can back into the bowl.
• Reserve the soaking water, straining it if it has grit or dirt.
• Discard the stems, then finely chop the shiitake mushroom caps.
• Add the chili bean paste, rice wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and Sichuan pepper (to taste) to the bowl of mushroom soaking water, stirring to incorporate. This will be your sauce.
• Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. It is hot enough when a bead of water sizzles and evaporates on contact.
• Add the peanut or vegetable oil and swirl to coat.
• Add the minced mushrooms; stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the mushrooms are crispy.
• Reduce the heat to medium; add the black bean sauce, white parts of the scallions, garlic and ginger; stir-fry for about 1 minute, until fragrant.
• Pour in the mushroom-mixture sauce; once the liquid starts to boil, reduce to a gentle bubbling over medium-low heat. The liquid in the pan should be a nice red color.
• Gently add the tofu cubes, being careful to not move them around too much so they don’t break up.
• Cook for 2-3 minutes so the tofu cooks and absorbs the sauce. You can spoon some of the sauce over the tofu cubes to help better coat them.
• Carefully push the tofu to the sides and create a small well at the center of the pan. Stir in the cornstarch mixture there.
• Cook for another minute, until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.
• Transfer to a deep plate or wide bowl, sprinkle the scallion greens on top with additional Sichuan pepper as needed, and serve hot.

Vegan Mac Daddy

ingredients
THE CHEEZY SAUCE
4 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 garlic cloves, Minced
2 pinches dried thyme (crumbled in your fingers)
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 pinches freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1 1/2 cups nutritional yeast flakes
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard
2 cups small broccoli florets

THE MAC
3/4 lb elbow macaroni
1 lb extra firm tofu
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

directions
• Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
• Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook macaroni.

Meanwhile, prepare the Cheezy Sauce
• Whisk the broth and flour in a measuring cup with a fork until dissolved.
• Saute the oil and garlic in a saucepan over medium-low heat about 2 minutes, stirring often and being careful not to burn the garlic.
• Add the thyme, salt, and pepper, and cook for about 15 seconds.
• Add the broth, turmeric, and nutritional yeast, raising the heat to medium.
• Use a whisk and stir constantly. The mixture will start bubbling and thickening in about 3 minutes; if it doesn’t, turn the heat on a bit higher.
• Once the mixture starts bubbling and thickening, stir and cook for about 2 more minutes.
• Add the lemon juice and mustard and stir well. The mixture should resemble a thick, melty cheese.
• Taste for salt (you may need more), turn off the heat, and cover the pan to keep it warm.

Now that the sauce is ready, begin assembling:
• Crumble the tofu into an 11x13 inch baking dish.
• Mash the tofu with your hands until it resembles ricotta cheese.
• Mix in the salt, olive oil, and lemon juice.
• Add 1/2 cup Cheezy Sauce to the tofu and stir.
• Add the pasta to the tofu, along with 3 more cups of sauce, and stir well.
• Smooth the top of the pasta mixture and press it down with a spatula to level it.
• Pour the remaining sauce over the pasta and smooth again.
• Bake for 30 minutes; the top of the macaroni should be slightly browned.
• Let sit for 20 minutes to cool and firm up.
