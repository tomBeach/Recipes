Shepards Pie
ingredients
POTATOES
1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes
1/4 cup half-and-half
2 ounces unsalted butter
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 egg yolk

FILLING
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 cup chopped onion
2 carrots, peeled and diced small
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 pounds ground lamb
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons tomato paste
1 cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons freshly chopped rosemary leaves
1 teaspoon freshly chopped thyme leaves
1/2 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
1/2 cup fresh or frozen English peas

instructions
POTATOES
• Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
• Place the half-and-half and butter into a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until warmed through, about 35 seconds.
• Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the saucepan. Mash the potatoes and then add the half and half, butter, salt and pepper and continue to mash until smooth. Stir in the yolk until well combined.
• Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

FILLING
• While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling. Place the canola oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrots and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
• Add the garlic and stir to combine. Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes.
• Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute.
• Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine.
• Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.
• Add the corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish.
• Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula.
• Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown.
• Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.






American Meatloaf

ingredients
MEAT
3 slices white bread
1 lg carrot peeled and cut into 1/4" pieces
1 rib celery cut into 1/2" pieces
1/2 medium yellow onion peeled and roughly chopped
2 cloves garlic smashed and peeled
1/2 cup flat leaf parsley leaves loosely packed
1/2 cup ketchup
2 tsps dry mustard
8 oz ground pork
8 oz ground chicken
8 oz ground round
2 lg eggs beaten
2 tsps salt
2 tsp pepper
2 tsp Worcestershire
1/2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary plus more needles for sprinkling

GLAZE
3 TB ketchup
2 TB dark brown sugar
1 TB olive oil
1 sm red onion cut into 1/4" thick rings
3 slices bacon, halved crosswise


instructions
• Heat oven to 400 degrees.

• Remove crusts from bread and place in the bowl of a food processor. Process till fine crumbs form about 10 seconds. Transfer breadcrumbs to a large mixing bowl. Do not substitute dried breadcrumbs in this step as they will make your meatloaf rubbery.

• Place carrot, celery, yellow onion, garlic and parsley in the bowl of the food processor. Process till vegs have been minced (about 30 seconds), stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice. Note: Chopping vegetables this way saves time and ensures that vegs will be small enough to cook through and not be crunchy.

• Transfer veggies to bowl with the breadcrumbs.

• Add 1/2 cup ketchup, 2 tsp dry mustard, pork, chicken, beef, eggs, salt, pepper, Worcestershire, and rosemary. Using your hands, knead the ingredients till thoroughly combined about one minute. Note: Be careful not to over-knead; doing so will result in a heavy and dense meatloaf. The texture should be wet, but tight enough to hold a free-form shape.

• Pack into a lightly greased loaf pan.

Note: substitute grated potato or carrots for a portion of the meat, which will also eliminate some of the calories. Baking the meatloaf on a rack will keep it out of the fatty drippings.

GLAZE
• Place the remaining 3 TBs ketchup, remaining 2 1/2 tsp mustard, and brown sugar in a bowl. Mix till smooth.

• Using a pastry brush, generously brush the glaze over meatloaf.

•  Place oil in a medium saucepan set over high heat. When oil is smoking add red onion. Cook stirring occasionally till onion is soft and golden in places.

• Add 3 TBs water, and cook, stirring till most of water has evaporated.

• Transfer onion to a bowl to cool slightly, then sprinkle onion over the meatloaf.

• Bake 30 minutes, then sprinkle rosemary needles on top.

• Reduce temp to 350 degrees and cover with bacon.  Continue baking loaf till an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the meatloaf registers 160 degrees, about 25 minutes more.

• Let meatloaf cool on rack, 15 minutes.

 Pot Roast
http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/perfect-pot-roast-recipe.html?oc=linkback

ingredients

Salt and freshly ground black pepper
One 3 to 5-pound chuck roast
2 or 3 tablespoons olive oil
2 whole onions, peeled and halved
6 to 8 whole carrots, unpeeled, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 cup red wine, optional
3 cups beef broth
2 or 3 sprigs fresh rosemary
2 or 3 sprigs fresh thyme

instructions
• Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.
• Generously salt and pepper the chuck roast.
• Heat the olive oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the halved onions to the pot, browning them on both sides. Remove the onions to a plate.
• Throw the carrots into the same very hot pot and toss them around a bit until slightly browned, about a minute or so. Reserve the carrots with the onions.
• If needed, add a bit more olive oil to the very hot pot. Place the meat in the pot and sear it for about a minute on all sides until it is nice and brown all over. Remove the roast to a plate.
• With the burner still on high, use either red wine or beef broth (about 1 cup) to deglaze the pot, scraping the bottom with a whisk. Place the roast back into the pot and add enough beef stock to cover the meat halfway.
• Add in the onions and the carrots, along with the fresh herbs.
• Put the lid on, then roast for 3 hours for a 3-pound roast. For a 4 to 5-pound roast, plan on 4 hours. The roast is ready when it's fall-apart tender.
